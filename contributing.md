### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/moonstonemedia/WP-Google-Calendar-Events/issues) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help us fix it by submitting an issue report:

1. Isolate your issue, check for theme or plugin compatibility issues first.
2. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
3. Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/moonstonemedia/WP-Google-Calendar-Events/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there.
4. Submit a report for your issue:
    * Clearly describe the issue.
    * Include steps to reproduce the issue if it's a bug.
    * If it's a compatibility issue, please add further details.

### Making Changes

If you are knowledgeable of PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and notice something that can be improved for the benefit of all users of this software, then you can propose your changes and issue a pull request (PR) here on GitHub.

#### How To Submit A Pull Request

First, fork this repository on GiHub or clone to your machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/moonstonemedia/Simple-Calendar
    
This project uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), to grab dependencies and have a working copy you will need to run:

    $ composer install
    $ composer dump-autoload -o

If you plan to work with stylesheets or JavaScript you may want to use Grunt as well:

    $ npm install

Make your changes locally, and push them to your forked repository.

Issue a pull request in the original repository with your remote branch (use the master branch as target, do not bother with other branches).

There are a few things to keep in mind when making changes and developing locally for this project.

* The most important one is to **ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/)**.

* Please **don't** modify the changelogs or readme.txt or other meta assets.
* Please **don't** add your localizations or update the .pot file(s) - use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/moonstonemedia/simple-calendar/) instead.
